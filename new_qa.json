            "Question 1: What is the Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) if the Net Income in 2019 is 10 million and there are 2 million shares of convertible preferred stock?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Diluted EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / (Common Shares Outstanding + Convertible Preferred Shares)>, we need to assume that there are no preferred dividends. So the answer would be 10 / (1217121 + 2000000).\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Options Overhang if there are 10 million common shares outstanding?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Options Overhang = Outstanding Stock Options / Common Shares Outstanding>, we know that Outstanding Stock Options is 1217121 and Common Shares Outstanding is 10 million. So the answer would be 1217121 / 10000000.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT) if the current stock price is $100?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <SVT = (Number of Options * Option Value) / Market Value of Company>, where Option Value = Current Stock Price - Exercise Price of the Option, we know the number of options is 1217121, the exercise price is 308.10 and the Market Value of the Company is the current stock price multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding. Assuming the number of common shares outstanding is 10 million, the answer would be (1217121 * (100 - 308.10)) / (100 * 10000000)."

To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% (90%) of our adjusted taxable income to our stockholders. Management intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and to maintain our REIT status. As a REIT, we are entitled to a tax deduction for some or all of the dividends we pay to shareholders. Accordingly, we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we distribute an amount equal to or in excess of our taxable income currently to shareholders. We are also generally subject to federal income taxes on any taxable income that is not currently distributed to our shareholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. REIT qualification reduces, but does not eliminate, the amount of state and local taxes we pay. In addition, our financial statements include the operations of taxable corporate subsidiaries that are not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and are subject to corporate federal, state and local income taxes. As a REIT, we may also be subject to certain federal excise taxes if we engage in certain types of transactions."

            "Question 1: What is the Earnings per Share (EPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <EPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), and Average Outstanding Shares is 201206. So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / 201206.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Diluted Earnings per Share (DEPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <DEPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / (Common Shares Outstanding + Dilutive Securities)>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), Common Shares Outstanding is 201206, and Dilutive Securities is 0 (as there are no dilutive securities in 2009). So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / (201206 + 0).\n\nQuestion 3: What is the tax shield for the dividends paid to shareholders in 2009?\nAnswer 3: As the company is a REIT, it gets a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. The tax shield can be calculated using the formula <Tax Shield = Tax Rate * Debt>. In this case, we don't have the specific numbers for Tax Rate and Debt. However, the concept of a tax shield would apply. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the dividend payout ratio in 2007?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends / Net Income>, we know that Dividends is -1149 (assuming negative dividends means they were not paid), and Net Income is 210793. So the answer is -1149 / 210793."

            "Question 1: What would be the Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity if the Jpmorgan Chase's credit spread increased by 2 basis points on December 31, 2008?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <DVA Sensitivity = Sensitivity for 1 basis point * Increase in Basis Points>, we know the sensitivity for 1 basis point on December 31, 2008 is ￥32 and the increase in basis points is 2, so the answer is 32*2=￥64 million.\n\nQuestion 2: If the firm wants to maintain the Value at Risk (VaR) at the level of ¥85 million under a 95% confidence interval, how many times a year can the firm expect to incur daily losses greater than those predicted by VaR estimates?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Expected Exceedance = Number of Trading Days * (1- Confidence Level)>, we assume there are 252 trading days in a year and the confidence level is 95%, so the answer is 252*(1-0.95)= approximately 13 times a year.\n\nQuestion 3: If the firm expects an increase in interest rates, how would this impact the firm's net interest income and pre-tax earnings?\nAnswer 3: This requires the use of the formula <Net Interest Income = Interest Income - Interest Expense> and the formula <Pre-tax Earnings = Gross Income - Operating Expenses>. The exact impact would depend on the specifics of the interest rate increase and the firm's interest income and expense. However, generally, an increase in interest rates would increase both the firm's interest income and expense, and thus could impact the net interest income and pre-tax earnings."

We can assume the Basic Shares Outstanding and Shares from Conversion of Convertible Securities do not exist, so the answer is 151945+1534294=1685239 shares.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Expected Price per Share under the equity compensation plans approved by securityholders?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Expected Price per Share = Total Equity Value / Fully Diluted Shares>, we know the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 151945, and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans is 2140954. We can assume the Total Equity Value is the sum of these two, so the answer is (151945+2140954)/1685239=￥1.57 per share.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Dilution Ratio for the equity compensation plans approved by securityholders?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Dilution Ratio = (New Shares Issued / Total Shares After Issuance)>, we know the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, and rights is 151945, and the total shares after issuance is 1685239.

So the answer is 30.7/2.1.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the percentage of total facilities located in other countries?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Percentage of Total Facilities in Other Countries = (Total Facilities in Other Countries / Total Facilities) * 100>, we know that the total facilities in other countries are 23.2 million square feet and the total facilities are 56.0 million square feet. So the answer is (23.2/56.0) * 100."

Conduits.\nCommercial paper issued by conduits for which the firm acts as administrator aggregated ¥11.7 billion at December 31, 2003, and ¥17.5 billion at December 31, 2002.\nThe commercial paper issued is backed by sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and commitments to provide liquidity to support receiving at least an A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, an F1 rating.\nThe firm had commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to ¥18.0 billion at December 31, 2003, and ¥23.5 billion at December 31, 2002.\nThird-party banks had commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to ¥700 million at December 31, 2003, and up to ¥900 million at December 31, 2002.\nAsset-specific liquidity is the primary source of liquidity support for the conduits.\nIn addition, program-wide liquidity is provided by JPMorgan Chase to these vehicles in the event of short-term disruptions in the commercial paper market; these commitments totaled ¥2.6 billion and ¥2.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\nFor certain multi-seller conduits, JPMorgan Chase also provides limited credit enhancement, primarily through the issuance of letters of credit.\nCommitments under these letters of credit totaled ¥1.9 billion and ¥3.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.\nJPMorgan Chase applies the same underwriting standards in making liquidity commitments to conduits as the firm would with other extensions of credit.\nIf JPMorgan Chase were downgraded below A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, F1, the firm could also be required to provide funding under these liquidity commitments, since commercial paper rated below A-1, P-1 or F1 would generally not be issuable by the vehicle.\nUnder these circumstances, the firm could either replace itself as liquidity provider or facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets held in the vie in other markets.\nJPMorgan Chase's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles at December 31, 2003, is ¥18.7 billion, as the firm cannot be obligated to fund the entire notional amounts of asset-specific liquidity, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement facilities at the same time.\nHowever, the firm views its credit exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited.\nThis is because, for the most part, the firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if the assets in the vie are in default.\nAdditionally, the firm's obligations under the letters of credit are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the client or other third parties – for example, by the overcollateralization of the vie with the assets sold to it.\nJPMorgan Chase consolidated these asset-backed commercial paper conduits at July 1, 2003, in accordance with FIN 46 and recorded the assets and liabilities of the conduits on its consolidated balance sheet.\nIn December 2003, one of the multi-seller conduits was restructured with the issuance of preferred securities acquired by an independent third-party investor, who will absorb the majority of the expected losses of the conduit.\nIn determining the primary beneficiary of the conduit, the firm leveraged an existing rating agency model that is an independent market standard to size the expected losses and considered the relative rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders.\nAs a result of the restructuring, JPMorgan Chase deconsolidated approximately ¥5.4 billion of the vehicle's assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2003.\nThe remaining conduits continue to be consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at December 31, 2003: ¥4.8 billion of assets recorded in loans, and ¥1.5 billion of

statements.\nThe risks inherent in derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit, market and liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed.\nAssets held by

The awards have a contractual life of five to ten years and vest over two to four years. Stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed or replaced with comparable stock options or stock appreciation rights in conjunction with a change in control of the company only become exercisable if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or quits for good reason within 24 months of a change in control. The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to purchase shares of the company's common stock through payroll deductions of up to 20% (20%) of eligible compensation on an after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than ¥25000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee pays per share is 85% (85%) of the lower of the fair market value of the company's stock on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the purchase period.

            "Question 1: What is the average annual increase in rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Average Annual Increase = [(End Value/Start Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1]>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the present value of future lease obligations discounted at an annual interest rate of 5%?\nAnswer 2: We can use the formula for present value of an annuity: <Present Value = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r]>, where C is the annual cash flow (lease payment), r is the interest rate (5% or 0.05), and n is the number of years. As the lease payments vary by year, we need to calculate the present value of each year's lease payment separately and then sum them up.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (End Value / Start Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the ratio of the total future minimum rental payments to the aggregate rent expense in 2014?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Ratio = Total Future Minimum Rental Payments / Aggregate Rent Expense>, we know the Total Future Minimum Rental Payments is ¥6903188 thousand and the Aggregate Rent Expense is ¥655.0 million. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the annual depreciation expense if the total lease obligations are depreciated straight-line over 10 years?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Annual Depreciation Expense = (Total Lease Obligations / Useful Life)>, we know the Total Lease Obligations is ¥6903188 thousand and the Useful Life is 10 years. So the answer can be calculated with this formula."
