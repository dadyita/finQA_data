It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets.

So the answer is -46/-316=0.14556962025, or 14.56%.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Net Operating Loss (NOL) for the year 2018?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Net Operating Loss = Gross Income - Taxable Income>, we know the Gross Income is -6,806 (Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes) and the Taxable Income is -6,775 (Net income (loss) from continuing operations after taxes). So the answer is -6,806-(-6,775)=-31 millions.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the total tax rate for the year 2020?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Total Tax Rate = (Current Tax Expense + Deferred Tax Expense) / Pre-Tax Income>, we know the Current Tax Expense is 259, Deferred Tax Expense is -340 and Pre-Tax Income is 675. So the answer is (259-340)/675=-0.12, or -12%. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the Adjusted Taxable Income for the year 2020?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Adjusted Taxable Income = Taxable Income + Deferred Tax Expense>, we know the Taxable Income is 675 and Deferred Tax Expense is -340. So the answer is 675-340=335 millions.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the Current Tax Rate for the year 2019?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Current Tax Rate = Current Tax Expense / Pre-Tax Income>, we know the Current Tax Expense is 307 and Pre-Tax Income is -316. So the answer is 307/-316=-0.97151898734, or -97.15%."

Currently, CSX is rated BBB+ with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's at December 2012.  Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade.  If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt.  In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.",

Currently, CSX is rated BBB+ with a stable outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's, compared to a rating of BBB with a positive outlook by S&P and Baa2 with a stable outlook by Moody's at December 2012.  Ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade.  If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to below investment grade levels, the Company could experience significant increases in its interest cost for new debt.  In addition, a decline in CSX’s credit ratings to below investment grade levels could adversely affect the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt.",

            "Question 1: What is the year-on-year growth rate of the pension plan assets from 2021 to 2022?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Year-on-year growth rate = (Value in later year - Value in earlier year) / Value in earlier year>, we know the total asset value in 2022 is $307 million and in 2021 it was $438 million, so the answer is (307-438)/438=-0.299 or -29.9%.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the proportion of Level 1 assets in the total pension plan assets for the year 2022?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Proportion = Part / Whole>, we know the Level 1 assets in 2022 is $100 million and the total asset is $307 million, so the answer is 100/307=0.326 or 32.6%.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the change in the value of Equity mutual funds from 2021 to 2022?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Change in value = Value in later year - Value in earlier year>, we know the value of Equity mutual funds in 2022 is $6 million and in 2021 it was $33 million, so the answer is 6-33=-27 million.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the Bond mutual funds from 2020 (assuming the value was $200 million) to 2022?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <CAGR = [(Value in later year / Value in earlier year) ^ (1 / Number of years) - 1], we know the value of Bond mutual funds in 2022 is $110 million and in 2020 it was $200 million, so the answer is [(110/200)^(1/2)]-1=-0.301 or -30.1%."

The increase was partially due to the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations in July 2013 as well as lower commodity costs, primarily in our North America finished goods business, and favorable geographic mix. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the impact of the deconsolidation of our Brazilian bottling operations.\nThe favorable geographic mix was primarily due to growth in emerging markets. Although this shift in geographic mix has a negative impact on net operating revenues, it generally has a favorable impact on our gross profit margin due to the correlated impact it has on our product mix. The product mix in the majority of our emerging and developing markets is more heavily skewed toward our sparkling beverage products, which generally yield a higher gross profit margin compared to our still beverages and finished products.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses.\nThe following table sets forth the significant components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, | 2015 | 2014 | 2013\nStock-based compensation expense | $236 | $209 | $227\nAdvertising expenses | 3,976 | 3,499 | 3,266\nSelling and distribution expenses | 6,025 | 6,412 | 6,419\nOther operating expenses | 6,190 | 7,098 | 7,398\nSelling, general and administrative expenses | $16,427 | $17,218 | $17,310\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 versus Year Ended December 31, 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses decreased $791 million, or 5 percent. During the year ended December 31, 2015, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2014 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive programs as performance criteria were not achieved. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 13 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\nIn 2016, our pension expense is expected to decrease by $200 million compared to 2015. The anticipated decrease is primarily due to settlement and special termination costs incurred in 2015 of $169 million, the new method to calculate service and interest costs, an increase in the weighted-average discount rate used to calculate the Company's benefit obligations and the impact of $471 million of contributions the Company made in early 2016 to U.S. pension plans. The impact of these items will be partially offset by unfavorable asset performance compared to our expected return during 2015 and a decrease in the expected return on assets for U.S. plans.

It is used to assess the 'operating' profit of the business. It is a rough way of calculating how much cash the business is generating and is even sometimes called the 'operating cash flow'. It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets. EBITDA is typically closer to actual cash flow than is NOPAT . ... EBITDA can be calculated by adding back the costs of interest, depreciation, and amortization charges and any taxes incurred. ",

During the year ended December 31, 2015, fluctuations in foreign currency decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 6 percent. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily due to reversals in 2014 of previously recognized expenses related to the Company's long-term incentive programs as performance criteria were not achieved. The increase in advertising expenses reflects the Company's increased investments to strengthen our brands, partially offset by a foreign currency exchange impact of 13 percent. The decrease in selling and distribution expenses reflects the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The decrease in other operating expenses reflects the shift of the Company's marketing spending to more consumer-facing advertising expenses as well as savings from our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have a more significant impact on both advertising and other operating expenses as compared to our selling and distribution expenses since they are generally transacted in local currency. Our selling and distribution expenses are primarily related to our Company-owned bottling operations, of which the majority of expenses are attributable to CCR and are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.

The impact of these items will be partially offset by unfavorable asset performance compared to our expected return during 2015 and a decrease in the expected return on assets for U.S. plans.

The amortization of deferred acquisition costs is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from 1 to 40 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software.

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about finance and capital leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component.  Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n",

See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about finance and capital leases.",
            "Right-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities",
            "The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.",
            "The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.",
            "For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component.  Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities."

            "Question 1: What was the Net Present Value (NPV) of future cash flows in 2014?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <NPV = Σ {Future Cash Flow / [(1+i)^n]} - Initial Investment>, where i is the discount rate and n is the period number. Here we can use the \"Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\" as NPV and i as 10%. We don't have the Initial Investment so we will assume it's zero. So, the NPV for 2014 is $18,433,034 thousands.\n\nQuestion 2: What was the total change in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 2: We can calculate the total change using the formula <Total Change = Final Value - Initial Value>. So, the total change from 2012 to 2014 is $18,433,034 thousands - $11,180,357 thousands = $7,252,677 thousands.\n\nQuestion 3: What was the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 3: We can calculate the CAGR using the formula <CAGR = [(Final Value / Initial Value)^(1/n)] - 1>, where n is the number of years. So, the CAGR from 2012 to 2014 is [(18,433,034/11,180,357)^(1/2)] - 1 = 0.283 or 28.3%.\n\nQuestion 4: What was the Return on Investment (ROI) for the year 2014?\nAnswer 4: We can calculate the ROI using the formula <ROI = (Net Profit / Cost of Investment) * 100>. We have the Net Profit as the \"Net change\" and we can use the \"Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows at January 1\" as the Cost of Investment. So, the ROI for 2014 is (2,137,267/16,295,767) * 100 = 13.12%. \n\nQuestion 5: What was the average annual future cash inflow for the period 2012-2014?\nAnswer 5: We can calculate the average annual future cash inflow using the formula <Average Annual Future Cash Inflow = (Sum of Future Cash Inflows) / n>, where n is the number of years. So, the average annual future cash inflow for the period 2012-2014 is ($90,867,459 + $78,646,274 + $54,362,574) / 3 = $74,625,435.67 thousands."

It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets. EBITDA is typically closer to actual cash flow than is NOPAT . ... EBITDA can be calculated by adding back the costs of interest, depreciation, and amortization charges and any taxes incurred. ",

Base rent, adjusted for contractual escalations, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. Overage rent is paid by a tenant when its sales exceed an agreed upon minimum amount and is not recognized by the Company until the threshold is met.\nContract and Contract Related Liabilities.\nThe Company provides numerous products and services to its customers. There is often a timing difference between the cash payment by the customers and recognition of revenue for each of the associated performance obligations. The Company has the following main types of liabilities associated with contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, (2) loyalty program liability and (3) customer deposits and other deferred revenue for gaming and non-gaming products and services yet to be provided.\nThe outstanding chip liability represents the collective amounts owed to gaming promoters and patrons in exchange for gaming chips in their possession. Outstanding chips are expected to be recognized as revenue or redeemed for cash within one year of being purchased. The loyalty program liability represents a deferral of revenue until patron redemption of points earned.

The Total Contractual Liabilities for 2019 is 1332 million (calculated in question 1). For 2018, it is 551+66+827=1444 million. So the change is 1332-1444=-112 million."

Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company.

It is used to assess the 'operating' profit of the business. It is a rough way of calculating how much cash the business is generating and is even sometimes called the 'operating cash flow'. It can be useful because it removes factors that change the view of performance depending upon the accounting and financing policies of the business. Supporters argue it reduces management's ability to change the profits they report by their choice of accounting rules and the way they generate financial backing for the company. This metric excludes from consideration expenses related to decisions such as how to finance the business (debt or equity) and over what period they depreciate fixed assets. EBITDA is typically closer to actual cash flow than is NOPAT . ... EBITDA can be calculated by adding back the costs of interest, depreciation, and amortization charges and any taxes incurred. ",

In April 2019, the Company entered into a renewed agreement with the Macao government, which is effective through June 26, 2022, and provides for an annual payment of 38 million patacas (approximately $5 million at exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2019) as a substitution for a 12% tax otherwise due from VML shareholders on dividend distributions paid from VML gaming profits.

As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $526 million relating to the reduction of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets previously determined not likely to be utilized and also the revaluation of its U.S. deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate of 21%.

            "Question 1: What is the Effective Tax Rate for the year 2019?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Effective Tax Rate = Total Tax Expense / Pre-Tax Earnings>, we need to find out the Total Tax Expense and Pre-Tax Earnings, which are not directly mentioned in the report.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Deferred Tax Liability for the year 2019, assuming there are no changes in Property and Equipment, Prepaid Expenses, and Other items?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Deferred Tax Liability = Tax Rate * Temporary Difference>, we need to know the Tax Rate and Temporary Difference. The report does not provide this information.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Change in Deferred Tax Assets from 2018 to 2019?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Change in Deferred Tax Assets = Deferred Tax Assets (end of 2019) - Deferred Tax Assets (end of 2018)>, we can find the change as 363-502 = -139 million.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the Change in Net Operating Loss Carryforwards from 2018 to 2019?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Change in Net Operating Loss Carryforwards = Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (end of 2019) - Net Operating Loss Carryforwards (end of 2018)>, we find the change as 283-271 = 12 million. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning of 2018?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Unrecognized Tax Benefits (beginning of 2018) = Unrecognized Tax Benefits (end of 2017) + Additions to tax positions related to prior years (2018) + Additions to tax positions related to current year (2018) - Lapse in statutes of limitations (2018)>, we can calculate the value as 92+2+24-0 = 118 million."
