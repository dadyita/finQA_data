However, the report does not provide information on preferred dividends or the weighted average number of common shares, so we cannot calculate the EPS.\n\nQuestion 3: Using the formula \"Gross Cash Invested = (Gross Tangible and Intangible Assets before Depreciation or Write-offs) + (Investments in Associates) + (Working Capital)\", what was the Gross Cash Invested for EID ECP for the year ended December 31, 2019?\n\nAnswer: The financial report does not provide sufficient information to calculate Gross Cash Invested for EID ECP in 2019.\n\nQuestion 4: Using the formula \"Tangible Common Equity = Total Equity - Intangible Assets - Goodwill - Preferred Stock\", what was the Tangible Common Equity for EID ECP for the year ended December 31, 2019?\n\nAnswer: The financial report does not provide sufficient information to calculate Tangible Common Equity for EID ECP in 2019.\n\nQuestion 5: Using the formula \"Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) = (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes + Fixed Costs) / Earnings Before Interest and Taxes\", what was the Degree of Operating Leverage for EID ECP for the year ended December 31, 2019?\n\nAnswer: The financial report does not provide sufficient information to calculate the Degree of Operating Leverage for EID ECP in 2019.\n\nQuestion 1: \nUsing the Earnings Per Share formula, calculate the EPS for the year 2019 and 2018, assuming there are no Preferred Stock Dividends and the Weighted Average of Common Stock Shares Outstanding is 100 million.\n\nAnswer 1: \nFor 2019: EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Stock Dividends) / Weighted Average of Common Stock Shares Outstanding\n= ($19 million - $0) / 100 million = $0.19 per share\n\nFor 2018: EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Stock Dividends) / Weighted Average of Common Stock Shares Outstanding\n= ($151 million - $0) / 100 million = $1.51 per share\n\nQuestion 2: \nCalculate the Operating Cash Flow (OCF) for the year 2019 and 2018, assuming a tax rate of 30%.\n\nAnswer 2: \nFor 2019: OCF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation\n= ($23 million * (1 - 0.30)) + $28 million = $44.1 million\n\nFor 2018: OCF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + Depreciation\n= ($186 million * (1 - 0.30)) + $133 million = $263.8 million\n\nQuestion 3: \nCalculate the Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) for the year 2019 and 2018, assuming a Debt Ratio of 0.5 and no change in Working Capital.\n\nAnswer 3: \nFor 2019: FCFE = Net Income - [(1 - Debt Ratio) * (Capital Expenditure - Depreciation & Amortization) + (1 - Debt Ratio) * Change in Working Capital]\n= $19 million - [(1 - 0.5) * ($16 million - $28 million) + (1 - 0.5) * $0]\n= $25 million\n\nFor 2018: FCFE = Net Income - [(1 - Debt Ratio) * (Capital Expenditure - Depreciation & Amortization) + (1 - Debt Ratio) * Change in Working Capital]\n= $151 million - [(1 - 0.5) * ($77 million - $133 million) + (1 - 0.5) * $0]\n= $179 million\n\n\nTimeout, returning default value",

        "qa": "Question 1: \nUsing the DebtToTotalAssets formula, what is the DebtToTotalAssets ratio for the year 2022 considering the long-term debt and finance lease obligations as the debt component?\n\nAnswer 1: \nThe DebtToTotalAssets ratio for 2022 cannot be calculated as the report does not provide information on the total equity and non-financial liabilities.\n\nQuestion 2: \nGiven the formula for the Leverage Index (LVGI), what is the LVGI from 2021 to 2022?\n\nAnswer 2: \nThe Leverage Index from 2021 to 2022 cannot be calculated as the report does not provide information on the total assets for the years 2021 and 2022.\n\nQuestion 3: \nUsing the formula for Market Value Added (MVA), if the market value of the firm is $1.7 billion (cash and cash equivalents for 2022) and the capital invested is $15,232 million (long-term debt and finance lease obligations for 2022), what is the MVA?\n\nAnswer 3: \nThe MVA is $1.7 billion - $15.232 billion = -$13.532 billion. This indicates that the firm has destroyed value.\n\nQuestion 4: \nUsing the formula for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), if the net income is $84 million (fair value at end of period for contingent payments related to acquisitions in 2022), depreciation & amortization is $39 million (change in fair value recognized in earnings for contingent payments related to acquisitions in 2022), capital expenditure is $20 million (payments for contingent payments related to acquisitions in 2022), change in working capital is $10 million (transfers out of Level 3 for available-for-sale debt securities in 2022), and net borrowing is $299 million (short-term debt for 2022), what is the FCFE?\n\nAnswer 4: \nThe FCFE is $84 million + $39 million - $20 million - $10 million + $299 million = $392 million. This represents the cash available to equity shareholders after all expenses, reinvestments, and debt repayments.\n\nQuestion 5: \nUsing the formula for Cash Balance (CB), if the discount rate (i) is 2% (assumption), the average negative cash flow (nCF) is $1.3 billion (difference in cash and cash equivalents from 2021 to 2022), and the rate of return on the firm's assets (r) is 5% (assumption), what is the CB?\n\nAnswer 5: \nThe CB is sqrt((0.02 * -$1.3 billion) / (2 * 0.05)) = sqrt($-0.013 billion) = Not applicable as the square root of a negative number is not a real number. This suggests that the assumptions used may not be accurate.\n\nQuestion 1: \nUsing the formula for Financial Result, calculate the financial result for the year 2022, given that the interest income is the cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period, the interest expense is the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, and the write-downs for financial assets is the change in fair value recognized in earnings for contingent payments related to acquisitions.\n\nAnswer 1:\nFinancial Result = Interest Income - Interest Expense ± Write-downs for Financial Assets\n= $3.0 billion - $1.7 billion - $39 million\n= $1.261 billion\n\nQuestion 2:\nUsing the formula for Impairment Cost, what would be the impairment cost for the available-for-sale debt securities, if the recoverable amount is the fair value at the end of the period and the carrying value is the fair value at the beginning of the period?\n\nAnswer 2:\nImpairment Cost = Recoverable Amount - Carrying Value\n= $47 million - $30 million\n= $17 million\n\nQuestion 3:\nUsing the formula for Net Money Assets, calculate the net money assets at the end of 2022, if the claims are the cash and cash equivalents and the liabilities are the short-term debt.\n\nAnswer 3:\nNet Money Assets = Claims - Liabilities\n= $1.7 billion - $299 million\n= $1.401 billion\n\nQuestion 4:\nUsing the formula for Total Accruals to Total Assets, what is the ratio for 2022 if the Income from Continuing Operations is the sum of cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale debt securities, the Cash Flows from Operations is the sum of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, and long-term debt, and the Total Assets is the sum of cash and cash equivalents, short-term debt, long-term debt, and available-for-sale debt securities?\n\nAnswer 4:\nTotal Accruals to Total Assets = (Income from Continuing Operations - Cash Flows from Operations) / Total Assets\n= (($1.7 billion + $47 million) - ($1.7 billion + $299 million + $15.232 billion)) / ($1.7 billion + $299 million + $15.232 billion + $47 million)\n= -$13.784 billion / $17.278 billion\n= -0.798 or -79.8%\n\nQuestion 5:\nUsing the formula for Capital, calculate the capital at the end of 2022, given that the debt is the sum of short-term debt and long-term debt, and equity is the cash and cash equivalents.\n\nAnswer 5:\nCapital = Debt / (Debt + Equity)\n= ($299 million + $15.232 billion) / ($299 million + $15.232 billion + $1.7 billion)\n= $15.531 billion / $17.231 billion\n= 0.901 or 90.1%\n\nQuestion 1: Using the \"Carrying value\" formula, what is the carrying value of the available-for-sale debt securities at the end of 2022?\nAnswer 1: The carrying value is the historic cost plus change in value. From the report, we know that the fair value at the beginning of 2022 was $30 million, and there were additions of $23 million. The change in fair value recognized in earnings is not provided, but there was a change in fair value recognized in AOCI of $4 million. So, the carrying value is $30 million + $23 million + $4 million = $57 million.\n\nQuestion 2: Based on the \"Quick Ratio\" formula, what is the quick ratio for 2022 given that the company's current liabilities are $1.7 billion?\nAnswer 2: The quick ratio is calculated by adding cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, and then dividing the sum by current liabilities. From the report, we know that cash and cash equivalents were $1.7 billion in 2022. The report does not provide information on marketable securities and accounts receivable, so we can't calculate the exact quick ratio. However, if we assume that the company has no marketable securities and accounts receivable, the quick ratio would be $1.7 billion / $1.7 billion = 1. \n\nQuestion 3: Using the \"net worth\" formula, what is the company's net worth for 2022 if the company's tangible assets were $10 billion, claims were $2 billion, and liabilities were $15 billion?\nAnswer 3: The net worth is calculated by adding tangible assets and claims, and then subtracting liabilities. So, the company's net worth for 2022 would be $10 billion + $2 billion - $15 billion = -$3 billion.\n\nQuestion 4: According to the \"Sonkin ratio\" formula, what is the Sonkin ratio if the company's market capitalization is $20 billion, debt is $15 billion, cash is $1.7 billion, earnings before interest and taxes are $5 billion, and tax is $1 billion?\nAnswer 4: The Sonkin ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of market capitalization, debt, and negative cash by the difference between earnings before interest and taxes and tax. So, the Sonkin ratio would be ($20 billion + $15 billion - $1.7 billion) / ($5 billion - $1 billion) = 8.825.\n\nQuestion 5: Using the \"Liquidity at Risk\" formula, what is the company's liquidity at risk if the maturing liabilities are $1.105 billion, net scheduled outflows are $0.5 billion, net outflow of variation margin is $0.3 billion, and credit-contingent cash outflows are $0.2 billion?\nAnswer 5: The liquidity at risk is calculated by adding maturing liabilities, net scheduled outflows, net outflow of variation margin, and credit-contingent cash outflows. So, the company's liquidity at risk would be $1.105 billion + $0.5 billion + $0.3 billion + $0.2 billion = $2.105 billion.\n\nQuestion 1: According to the formula \"Equity Value = Market capitalization + Amount that in-the-money stock options are in the money + Value of equity issued from in-the-money convertible securities - Proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities\", if the market capitalization is $5 billion, the amount that in-the-money stock options are in the money is $1 billion, the value of equity issued from in-the-money convertible securities is $2 billion, and the proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities is $1 billion, what is the equity value?\n\nAnswer 1: The equity value would be $5 billion + $1 billion + $2 billion - $1 billion = $7 billion.\n\nQuestion 2: Using the formula \"Earnings Yield = (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes + Depreciation – CapEx) / Enterprise Value (Market Value + Debt – Cash)\", if the Earnings Before Interest & Taxes is $500 million, Depreciation is $100 million, CapEx is $200 million, Market Value is $5 billion, Debt is $2 billion and Cash is $1.7 billion, what is the Earnings Yield?\n\nAnswer 2: The Earnings Yield would be ($500 million + $100 million - $200 million) / ($5 billion + $2 billion - $1.7 billion) = 0.057 or 5.7%.\n\nQuestion 3: Given the formula \"Wealth = cash balances + government bonds + housing equity + stocks + other assets - debt\", if the cash balances are $1.7 billion, there are no government bonds, housing equity or other assets, stocks are worth $3 billion, and debt is $2 billion, what is the wealth?\n\nAnswer 3: The wealth would be $1.7 billion + $0 + $0 + $3 billion + $0 - $2 billion = $2.7 billion.\n\nQuestion 4: Based on the formula \"{\\\\displaystyle X=C+B}\", if the cash holdings are $1.7 billion and the borrowings are $2 billion, what are the total inputs a firm can purchase?\n\nAnswer 4: The total inputs a firm can purchase would be $1.7 billion + $2 billion = $3.7 billion.\n\nQuestion 5: Using the formula \"book value = original cost − accumulated depreciation\", if the original cost of an asset is $1 million and the accumulated depreciation is $200,000, what is the book value of the asset?\n\nAnswer 5: The book value of the asset would be $1 million - $200,000 = $800,000.\n\nQuestion 1: \nBased on the financial report and the formula for Adjusted Present Value (APV), what is the APV for the year 2022? (Assume that the Free Cash Flows are $1 billion, the Terminal Value is $2 billion, the Interest Tax Shield is $0.5 billion, and the Terminal Value of the Interest Tax Shield is $1 billion)\n\nAnswer 1: \nUsing the formula APV = Unlevered NPV of Free Cash Flows and assumed Terminal Value + NPV of Interest Tax Shield and assumed Terminal Value, we have APV = $1 billion + $2 billion + $0.5 billion + $1 billion = $4.5 billion.\n\nQuestion 2: \nUsing the formula for the Value of Unlevered Firm, what was the value of the unlevered firm in 2022, given that the value of unlevered assets was $10 billion and the excess cash and other assets were $1.7 billion?\n\nAnswer 2: \nUsing the formula Value of Unlevered Firm = Value of Unlevered Assets + Excess Cash & Other Assets, we have the Value of Unlevered Firm = $10 billion + $1.7 billion = $11.7 billion.\n\nQuestion 3: \nUsing the formula for Enterprise Value, what was the Enterprise Value for 2022, given that the market cap was $20 billion, debt at market value was $15.232 billion, minority interest at market value was $1 billion, preferred equity at market value was $2 billion, unfunded pension liabilities and other debt-deemed provisions were $0.5 billion, the value of associate companies was $1 billion, and cash and cash equivalents were $1.7 billion?\n\nAnswer 3: \nUsing the formula Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Market Value of Debt + Market Value of Minority Interest (if any) + Market Value of Preferred Equity + Unfunded Pension Liabilities and Other Debt-Deemed Provisions - Value of Associate Companies - Cash and Cash Equivalents, we have Enterprise Value = $20 billion + $15.232 billion + $1 billion + $2 billion + $0.5 billion - $1 billion - $1.7 billion = $35.032 billion.\n\nQuestion 4: \nUsing the formula for the Value of Levered Firm, what was the value of the levered firm in 2022, given that the value of the unlevered firm was $11.7 billion and the Present Value of Debt's Periodic Interest Tax Shield discounted by Cost of Debt Financing % was $1.5 billion?\n\nAnswer 4: \nUsing the formula Value of Levered Firm = Value of Unlevered Firm + Present Value of Debt's Periodic Interest Tax Shield discounted by Cost of Debt Financing %, we have Value of Levered Firm = $11.7 billion + $1.5 billion = $13.2 billion.",

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the balance of deferred acquisition costs was $271 million and $22 million, respectively, comprised primarily of commissions paid on Medicare Supplement products within the Health Care Benefits segment.\nProperty and Equipment.\nProperty and equipment is reported at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from 1 to 40 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and 3 to 10 years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated.\nProperty and equipment consists of the following at December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nIn millions | 2019 | 2018\nLand | $1,981 | $1,872\nBuilding and improvements | 4,068 | 3,785\nFixtures and equipment | 13,807 | 13,028\nLeasehold improvements | 5,611 | 5,384\nSoftware | 3,467 | 2,800\nTotal property and equipment | 28,934 | 26,869\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization | (16,890) | (15,520)\nProperty and equipment, net | $12,044 | $11,349\n\nDepreciation expense (which includes the amortization of property and equipment under finance or capital leases) totaled $1.9 billion in the year ended December 31, 2019 and $1.7 billion in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about finance and capital leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component.  Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n",

Again, without the exact figure for liabilities, we can't compute the exact net money assets for 2018.\n\nQuestion 2: Using the Operating Cash Flow formula, what would be the Operating Cash Flow if the earnings before interest and tax for the year 2019 were $2.5 billion, the tax was $500 million and the depreciation was $1.9 billion?\n\nAnswer 2: \nOperating Cash Flow = Incremental Earnings + Depreciation = (Earnings Before Interest and Tax - Tax) + Depreciation = ($2.5 billion - $500 million) + $1.9 billion = $3.9 billion.\n\nQuestion 3: If the company had equity capital of $10 billion in 2019 and the cost of equity was 8%, what would be the equity charge for that year based on the Equity Charge formula?\n\nAnswer 3: \nEquity Charge = Equity Capital * Cost of Equity = $10 billion * 8% = $800 million.\n\nQuestion 4: Based on the formula for Embedded Value (EV), if the Present Value of Future Profits was $5 billion and the Adjusted Net Asset Value was $3 billion, what would be the Embedded Value?\n\nAnswer 4: \nEmbedded Value = Present Value of Future Profits + Adjusted Net Asset Value = $5 billion + $3 billion = $8 billion.\n\nQuestion 5: Using the Earnings Yield formula, if the Earnings Before Interest & Taxes for 2019 were $2.5 billion, depreciation was $1.9 billion, CapEx was $1 billion, the market value of the company was $15 billion, debt was $5 billion and cash was $2 billion, what would be the Earnings Yield?\n\nAnswer 5: \nEarnings Yield = (Earnings Before Interest & Taxes + Depreciation - CapEx) / (Market Value + Debt - Cash) = ($2.5 billion + $1.9 billion - $1 billion) / ($15 billion + $5 billion - $2 billion) = 0.28 or 28%.\n\nTimeout, returning default value\n\nQuestion 1: \nUsing the Market Capitalization formula, how would you calculate the Market Capitalization for the Health Care Benefits segment, given that the Net Working Capital is $500 million, Net Fixed Assets are $1 billion, Routine Intangible Assets are $300 million, and Intellectual Property is $200 million?\n\nAnswer 1:\nMarket Capitalization = Net Working capital + Net Fixed assets + Routine Intangible assets + IP\n= $500 million + $1 billion + $300 million + $200 million\n= $2 billion\n\nQuestion 2: \nGiven the Assets (A) = Liabilities (L) + Equity (E) formula, if the company's assets are worth $12,044 million and its liabilities are worth $10,000 million, what is the company's equity?\n\nAnswer 2:\nEquity = Assets - Liabilities\n= $12,044 million - $10,000 million\n= $2,044 million\n\nQuestion 3: \nUsing the Gross Cash Invested (GCI) formula, if the Gross Tangible and Intangible Assets before Depreciation or Write-offs are $20 billion, Investments in Associates are $5 billion, and Working Capital is $3 billion, what is the Gross Cash Invested?\n\nAnswer 3:\nGross Cash Invested = (Gross Tangible and Intangible Assets before Depreciation or Write-offs) + (Investments in Associates) + (Working Capital)\n= $20 billion + $5 billion + $3 billion\n= $28 billion\n\nQuestion 4: \nUsing the EBIT formula, if the revenue is $50 billion, cost of goods sold is $20 billion, selling, general, and administrative expenses are $10 billion, and depreciation/amortization is $5 billion, what is the EBIT?\n\nAnswer 4:\nEBIT = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold - Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses - Depreciation/Amortization\n= $50 billion - $20 billion - $10 billion - $5 billion\n= $15 billion\n\nQuestion 5: \nUsing the Total Lease Cost formula, if the monthly lease payment is $100,000 and the lease term is 12 months, what is the total lease cost?\n\nAnswer 5:\nTotal Lease Cost = Monthly Payment x Lease Term\n= $100,000 x 12\n= $1,200,000\n\nQuestion 1: \nBased on the information provided in the financial report, can you calculate the book value of the property and equipment for the years 2019 and 2018 using the formula for book value?\n\nAnswer 1: \nYes, the book value of the property and equipment for the year 2019 is $12,044 million and for the year 2018, it is $11,349 million as provided in the financial report.\n\nQuestion 2: \nUsing the formula for Capital Employed, can you calculate the capital employed for the company in 2019?\n\nAnswer 2: \nWe don't have enough information in the financial report to calculate the Capital Employed. We need information about Account Receivables, Inventories and Account Payables, which is not provided in the report.\n\nQuestion 3: \nCan you calculate the depreciable base for the property and equipment for the years 2019 and 2018 using the formula for depreciable base?\n\nAnswer 3: \nWe don't have enough information in the financial report to calculate the depreciable base. We need information about the salvage value of the property and equipment, which is not provided in the report.\n\nQuestion 4: \nUsing the information in the financial report and the formula for Operating Expense, can you calculate the operating expense for the company in 2019?\n\nAnswer 4: \nThe operating expense for the company in 2019 includes the depreciation expense of $1.9 billion. However, we don't have enough information to calculate the total operating expense as we don't have information about other expenses such as maintenance, utilities, rent, taxes, and payroll.\n\nQuestion 5: \nCan you calculate the total accruals to total assets for the company in 2019 using the formula for Total Accruals to Total Assets?\n\nAnswer 5: \nWe don't have enough information in the financial report to calculate the Total Accruals to Total Assets. We need information about the Income from Continuing Operations and Cash Flows from Operations, which is not provided in the report.\n\nQuestion 1: \nUsing the Net Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) formula, what was the company's Net Capital Expenditure in 2019 and 2018?\n\nAnswer 1: \nIn 2019, the Net Capital Expenditure = Capital Expenditures - Depreciation & Amortization = $28,934 million - $1.9 billion = $27,034 million.\nIn 2018, the Net Capital Expenditure = Capital Expenditures - Depreciation & Amortization = $26,869 million - $1.7 billion = $25,169 million.\n\nQuestion 2: \nUsing the formula for annual depreciation expense, how much was the annual depreciation expense in 2019, assuming a residual value of $0 and the actual production equaled the estimated total production?\n\nAnswer 2: \nAnnual Depreciation Expense = (Cost of Fixed Asset - Residual Value) / Estimated Total Production × Actual Production\nAssuming the actual production equaled the estimated total production and a residual value of $0, the Annual Depreciation Expense in 2019 = ($28,934 million - $0) / 1 × 1 = $28,934 million.\n\nQuestion 3: \nUsing the formula for DAC amortization rate, calculate the DAC amortization rate for 2019, assuming that the present value of DAE is $271 million, the accumulated value of DAC is $22 million, the present value of estimated gross profits (EGPs) is $500 million, and the accumulated value of actual gross profits (AGPs) is $450 million.\n\nAnswer 3: \nDAC Amortization Rate = (Present Value of Deferred Acquisition Expenses + Accumulated Value of Deferred Acquisition Costs) / (Present Value of Estimated Gross Profits + Accumulated Value of Actual Gross Profits)\nDAC Amortization Rate = ($271 million + $22 million) / ($500 million + $450 million) = $293 million / $950 million = 0.308 or 30.8%.\n\nQuestion 4: \nUsing the formula for Carrying value, what is the carrying value for the property and equipment in 2019, if the change in value is equal to the depreciation and amortization?\n\nAnswer 4: \nCarrying value = Historic cost + Change in value\nIn this case, the historic cost is the cost of the property and equipment in 2019, which is $28,934 million. The change in value is equal to the depreciation and amortization, which is $1.9 billion or $1900 million. So the carrying value = $28,934 million - $1900 million = $27,034 million.",

            "The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.",
            "The Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.",
            "For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component.  Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities."

        "qa": "Question 1: If the net income of the company for the year 2019 was $5 million, dividends paid were $1 million and there were no buybacks, what would be the Augmented Payout Ratio for the company in the same year?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for Augmented Payout Ratio, we have (1 million + 0)/ 5 million = 0.2 or 20%\n\nQuestion 2: If the company has 1 million authorized shares, and has issued 600,000 shares, how many shares are unissued?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for Authorized Shares, we can calculate the number of unissued shares as 1 million - 600,000 = 400,000 shares\n\nQuestion 3: If the company's net profit for the year 2019 was $10 million, interest expense was $1 million, net capital expenditure was $2 million, there were no changes in working capital, and the tax shield on interest expense was $200,000, what was the company's free cash flow for the year?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for Free Cash Flow, we have 10 million + 1 million - 2 million - 0 - 200,000 = $8.8 million\n\nQuestion 4: If the company's net operating profit after taxes was $7 million, and the capital charge was $2 million, what was the company's Economic Value Added (EVA)?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for EVA, we have 7 million - 2 million = $5 million\n\nQuestion 5: If the company's total balance in company currency was $5 million, new funds in company currency were $1 million, total balance in voucher currency was $3 million, and new funds in voucher currency were $500,000, what was the new average rate?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for New Average Rate, we have (5 million + 1 million) / (3 million + 500,000) = 1.54\n\nQuestion 1: Using the formula for the Payout Ratio, if the company decided to give out dividends this year and the dividends per share were $2, and the free cash flow per share was $10, what would be the payout ratio?\n\nAnswer 1: The Payout Ratio can be calculated as follows: (Dividends per Share / Free Cash Flow per Share) × 100 = ($2 / $10) × 100 = 20%. \n\nQuestion 2: Using the formula for Net Operating Income (NOI), if the company had a net income of $10 million and operating expenses of $3 million, what would be the net operating income?\n\nAnswer 2: The Net Operating Income can be calculated as follows: Net Income - Operating Expenses = $10 million - $3 million = $7 million.\n\nQuestion 3: Using the formula for TATA, if the company had income from continuing operations of $5 million, cash flows from operations of $2 million, and total assets of $10 million, what would be the total accruals to total assets?\n\nAnswer 3: The Total Accruals to Total Assets can be calculated as follows: (Income from Continuing Operations - Cash Flows from Operations) / Total Assets = ($5 million - $2 million) / $10 million = 0.3 or 30%.\n\nQuestion 4: Using the formula for Net Free Cash Flow, if the company had operating cash flow of $4 million, maintenance capital expenses of $1 million, dividends of $500,000, current portion of long-term debt of $200,000, and depreciation of $300,000, what would be the net free cash flow?\n\nAnswer 4: The Net Free Cash Flow can be calculated as follows: Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance Capital Expenses - Dividends - Current Portion of Long-Term Debt - Depreciation = $4 million - $1 million - $500,000 - $200,000 - $300,000 = $2 million.\n\nQuestion 5: Using the formula for Operating Cash Flow, if the company had earnings before interest and tax of $3 million, tax of $1 million, and depreciation of $500,000, what would be the operating cash flow?\n\nAnswer 5: The Operating Cash Flow can be calculated as follows: (Earnings Before Interest and Tax - Tax) + Depreciation = ($3 million - $1 million) + $500,000 = $2.5 million.\n\nQuestion 1: \nGiven the EBIT, net fixed assets and working capital for the year 2019, can you calculate the company's return on capital?\n\nAnswer 1: \nThis question cannot be answered without the specific values for EBIT, net fixed assets and working capital. However, once these values are available, the formula \"EBIT / (net fixed assets + working capital)\" can be used to calculate the company's return on capital.\n\nQuestion 2: \nIf we know the Net Income, after-tax Non-operating Gains, after-tax Non-operating Losses and after-tax Interest Expense for the year 2019, can we calculate the NOPAT for the company?\n\nAnswer 2: \nThis question cannot be answered without the specific values for Net Income, after-tax Non-operating Gains, after-tax Non-operating Losses and after-tax Interest Expense. However, once these values are available, the formula \"NOPAT = (Net Income - after-tax Non-operating Gains + after-tax Non-operating Losses + after-tax Interest Expense)\" can be used to calculate the NOPAT for the company.\n\nQuestion 3: \nBased on the information about the executive officers and the formula for the throughput cost accounting ratio, can we determine the efficiency of the company's management?\n\nAnswer 3: \nThe throughput cost accounting ratio formula requires the profit and production hours, which are not provided in the executive officers' information. Therefore, we cannot determine the efficiency of the company's management using this formula and the provided information.\n\nQuestion 4: \nIf the company's EBIT for the year 2019 was $500,000 and the taxes on EBIT were $100,000, what was the company's NOPAT?\n\nAnswer 4: \nUsing the formula \"NOPAT = EBIT – Taxes on EBIT\", the NOPAT can be calculated as follows: NOPAT = $500,000 - $100,000 = $400,000. Therefore, the company's NOPAT for the year 2019 was $400,000.\n\nQuestion 1: Based on the formula for Times-Interest-Earned, how can we interpret the company's ability to honor its debt payments in relation to the tenure of Michael E. Haefner as the President and Chief Executive Officer?\n\nAnswer 1: Without specific financial figures from the report, we can't calculate the Times-Interest-Earned. However, we can say that if during Michael E. Haefner's tenure, the company was generating enough cash from its operations to meet its interest obligations (a TIE ratio above 2.5), it would indicate a healthy financial position.\n\nQuestion 2: Using the formula for Operating Cash Flow, how might Christopher T. Forsythe's role as Chief Financial Officer impact the calculation of this figure?\n\nAnswer 2: As Chief Financial Officer, Christopher T. Forsythe would be responsible for managing the company's finances, including its earnings before interest and tax, tax rate, and depreciation. These factors are directly used in the calculation of Operating Cash Flow. The efficiency of his financial management would impact the company's Operating Cash Flow.\n\nQuestion 3: Based on the formula for Free Cash Flows, how would the changes in the company's working capital and capital expenditures during David J. Park's tenure as Senior Vice President of Utility Operations affect this calculation?\n\nAnswer 3: Changes in working capital and capital expenditures are part of the calculation for Free Cash Flows. If during David J. Park's tenure, the company had large changes in working capital or made significant capital expenditures, it would decrease the company's Free Cash Flows. Conversely, if the company was able to minimize changes in working capital and control capital expenditures, it would result in higher Free Cash Flows.\n\nQuestion 4: According to the formula for Earnings Yield, how would the earnings before interest and taxes and the enterprise value of the company during Kim R. Cocklin's tenure as Executive Chairman of the Board affect the company's earnings yield?\n\nAnswer 4: The Earnings Yield is calculated using the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and its enterprise value. If during Kim R. Cocklin's tenure, the company had high EBIT and a lower enterprise value, it would result in a higher Earnings Yield, indicating a more profitable company. Conversely, if the company had lower EBIT or a higher enterprise value, it would result in a lower Earnings Yield.\n\nQuestion 1: Based on the information provided in the report and using the formula for Continuing Operations EPS, what would be the EPS if the income from continuing operations is $5 million, preferred dividends are $1 million and the weighted average common shares are 2 million?\nFormula: Continuing operations formula Earnings per share = (income from continuing operations − preferred dividends) / weighted average common shares\n\nAnswer: \nContinuing Operations EPS = ($5 million - $1 million) / 2 million = $2 per share\n\nQuestion 2: Using the Sonkin ratio formula, what would be the Sonkin ratio if the company's market capitalization is $10 billion, the debt is $5 billion, cash is $2 billion, earnings before interest and taxes is $1 billion, and tax is $0.2 billion?\nFormula: Sonkin ratio = (market capitalization + debt – cash) / (earnings before interest and taxes – tax)\n\nAnswer: \nSonkin Ratio = ($10 billion + $5 billion - $2 billion) / ($1 billion - $0.2 billion) = 16.5\n\nQuestion 3: If the company's net income is $1 million, depreciation is $0.5 million, amortization is $0.2 million and there are 1 million common shares outstanding, what would be the Cash Flow Per Share (CFPS) based on the formula provided?\nFormula: CFPS = (net income + Depreciation + Amortization)/ Common Shares Outstanding\n\nAnswer: \nCFPS = ($1 million + $0.5 million + $0.2 million) / 1 million = $1.7 per share\n\nQuestion 4: Using the Capital Employed (CE) formula, what would be the CE if the shareholders' equity is $8 million and the net financial debt is $2 million?\nFormula: CE = Shareholders’ Equity + Net Financial Debt\n\nAnswer: \nCapital Employed = $8 million + $2 million = $10 million",

        "qa": "Question 1: Using the P/E Ratio formula, if the earnings per share of CVS Health was $5 in 2019, what was the share price given a P/E Ratio of 20?\n\nAnswer: Using the P/E Ratio formula, which is Share Price = P/E Ratio * Earnings per Share, if the earnings per share is $5 and the P/E Ratio is 20, then the share price would be $100. \n\nQuestion 2: If the CVS Health's total stock-based compensation in 2019 was $453 million and the company had 32 million shares available for grants under the ICP, what would be the potential impact on the EVA if the company issued all available shares at once?\n\nAnswer: To answer this question, we would need to know the Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT), Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), Total Assets, and Current Liabilities of CVS Health. The issuance of new shares could potentially dilute the NOPAT per share and increase the Total Assets, thus affecting the EVA. However, without the exact financial figures, we cannot calculate the specific impact on the EVA.\n\nQuestion 3: If the strike price of a put option on CVS Health stock is $80 and the current stock price is $75, what is the value of the put option?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for the value of a put option, which is Strike Price - Current Stock Price, if the strike price is $80 and the current stock price is $75, then the value of the put option would be $5.\n\nQuestion 4: If CVS Health invested $200 million in the company (Capital), generated revenues of $100 million, and incurred expenses of $50 million, what would be the sum of equity changes across time?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for the sum of equity changes across time, which is Owner's Investment + Revenues - Expenses, if the owner's investment is $200 million, revenues are $100 million, and expenses are $50 million, then the sum of equity changes across time would be $250 million.\n\nQuestion 5: If CVS Health's dividends per share were $2 and the free cash flow per share was $5, what would be the payout ratio?\n\nAnswer: Using the formula for the payout ratio, which is (Dividends per Share / Free Cash Flow per Share) × 100, if the dividends per share are $2 and the free cash flow per share is $5, then the payout ratio would be 40%.\n\nQuestion 1: Using the Payout Ratio formula, what would be the payout ratio of CVS Health if the net income of the company for the year 2019 was $6 billion and the total dividends paid out (excluding preferred stock dividends) were $1.2 billion?\n\nAnswer 1: The Payout Ratio would be calculated as follows: Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends - Preferred Stock Dividends) / Net Income = $1.2 billion / $6 billion = 0.2 or 20%.\n\nQuestion 2: If CVS Health plans to issue additional shares for its Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP), and expects the next year's dividend per share to be $2, the current market price per share to be $75, flotation costs to be $5 per share, and the growth rate of dividends to be 4%, what would be the cost of internal equity using the given formula?\n\nAnswer 2: The Cost of internal equity would be calculated as follows: Cost of internal equity = [(next year's dividend per share / (current market price per share - issuance costs)] + dividend growth rate = [($2 / ($75 - $5)) + 0.04] = 0.0306667 or 3.07%.\n\nQuestion 3: If CVS Health's stock-based compensation for the year 2019 was $453 million and the company's total income for the year was $10 billion, what percentage of the company's total income was spent on stock-based compensation?\n\nAnswer 3: The percentage of the company's total income spent on stock-based compensation would be calculated as follows: ($453 million / $10 billion) * 100 = 4.53%.\n\nQuestion 4: Using the Post-Money Valuation (PMV) formula, what would be the post-money valuation of CVS Health if the total shares available for future grants under the Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) and the Amended Aetna Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (SIP) are 17 million and 27 million respectively, and the price per share is $75?\n\nAnswer 4: The Post-Money Valuation would be calculated as follows: PMV = Total Shares * Price per Share = (17 million + 27 million) * $75 = $3.3 billion.\n\nQuestion 1: \nGiven that the CVS Health 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (ICP) allows for a maximum of 32 million shares of CVS Health common stock to be reserved and available for grants, and as of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 17 million shares of CVS Health common stock available for future grants under the ICP, what is the value of the remaining position today, assuming the current stock price is $75 and the value of the call option is $10? Use the \"value of position today\" formula.\n\nAnswer 1: \nUsing the formula ValueToday = Delta × StockPriceCurrent - CallValue, where Delta is the number of shares, StockPriceCurrent is the current stock price, and CallValue is the value of the call option. We have:\nValueToday = 17 million × $75 - $10 = $1.27 billion\n\nQuestion 2: \nGiven the stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $453 million, $280 million, and $234 million respectively, what is the growth rate of the stock-based compensation?\n\nAnswer 2: \nWe can calculate the growth rate using the formula Growth = (Value in Year 2 - Value in Year 1) / Value in Year 1.\nGrowth rate from 2017 to 2018 = ($280 million - $234 million) / $234 million = 19.66%\nGrowth rate from 2018 to 2019 = ($453 million - $280 million) / $280 million = 61.79%\n\nQuestion 3: \nIf CVS Health pays a dividend of $2 per share, the growth rate of dividends is 3%, and the market price of the stock is $75, what is the expected return (or required rate of return for investors) using the formula Kcs = (Dividend Payment/Share * (1 + Growth)) / Price Market + Growth rate?\n\nAnswer 3: \nUsing the formula, we have Kcs = ($2 * (1 + 0.03)) / $75 + 0.03 = 0.05 or 5%.\n\nQuestion 4: \nIf the present value of CVS Health's stock is $75, the dividend paid by the stock is $2, the revenue growth rate for the period is 3%, and the discount rate is 5%, what is the present value of the stock using the discounted cash flow model?\n\nAnswer 4: \nUsing the formula PresentValue = Dividend * Σ((1 + GrowthRate_i) / (1 + DiscountRate))^i, and assuming the infinite series converges, we have PresentValue = $2 * ((1 + 0.03) / (1 + 0.05)) = $75. This confirms that the present value calculated using the discounted cash flow model is the same as the given present value of the stock.\n\nQuestion 1: \nAccording to the CVS Health 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”), the ICP allows for a maximum of 32 million shares of CVS Health common stock to be reserved and available for grants. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 17 million shares of CVS Health common stock available for future grants under the ICP. Using the formula for issued shares, how many shares of CVS Health common stock have been issued under the ICP as of December 31, 2019?\n\nAnswer 1: \nUsing the formula for issued shares, which is Issued Shares = Outstanding Shares + Treasury Shares, the number of issued shares under the ICP would be 32 million (maximum shares available for grants) - 17 million (shares available for future grants) = 15 million shares.\n\nQuestion 2: \nIn 2019, the total stock-based compensation was $453 million. If this amount represents the total dividends and stock buybacks, and given that the net income for the same period was $6.63 billion, what is the Augmented Payout Ratio?\n\nAnswer 2: \nUsing the formula for Augmented Payout Ratio, which is Augmented Payout Ratio = (Total Dividends + Stock Buybacks) / Net Income for the same period, the Augmented Payout Ratio would be $453 million / $6.63 billion = 0.068 or 6.8%.\n\nQuestion 3: \nAssuming the strike price for a call option under the CVS Health 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) was $80 and the current stock price of CVS Health common stock is $75, what is the value of the call option?\n\nAnswer 3: \nUsing the formula for the value of a call option, which is Call Option Value = Current Stock Price - Strike Price, the value of the call option would be $75 - $80 = -$5. This means the call option is out of the money and essentially worthless as it would be more expensive to exercise the option than to buy the shares on the open market.\n\nQuestion 1: Based on the report and the formula \"CashFlowPerShare = (NetIncome + Depreciation + Amortization) / CommonSharesOutstanding\", what would be the Cash Flow Per Share if the net income is $10 million, depreciation is $2 million, amortization is $1 million, and there are 5 million common shares outstanding under the ICP?\n\nAnswer 1: The Cash Flow Per Share would be calculated as follows: CFPS = ($10 million + $2 million + $1 million) / 5 million = $2.6 per share.\n\nQuestion 2: Using the formula \"Basic Earnings per Share (EPS) = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Common Shares\", and given that the net income is $7 million, preferred dividends are $1 million, and the weighted average common shares are 3 million under the ICP, what is the Basic Earnings per Share?\n\nAnswer 2: The Basic Earnings per Share would be calculated as follows: EPS = ($7 million - $1 million) / 3 million = $2 per share.\n\nQuestion 3: Considering the formula \"Equity Value = Market capitalization + Amount that in-the-money stock options are in the money + Value of equity issued from in-the-money convertible securities - Proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities\", if the market capitalization of CVS Health is $100 billion, the amount that in-the-money stock options are in the money is $10 billion, the value of equity issued from in-the-money convertible securities is $5 billion, and the proceeds from the conversion of convertible securities is $3 billion, what would be the Equity Value of CVS Health?\n\nAnswer 3: The Equity Value of CVS Health would be calculated as follows: Equity Value = $100 billion + $10 billion + $5 billion - $3 billion = $112 billion.\n\nQuestion 4: Using the formula \"Present Stock Value = Expected Dividend / Cost of Equity\", if the expected dividend per share is $2 and the cost of equity is 10%, what is the Present Stock Value?\n\nAnswer 4: The Present Stock Value would be calculated as follows: Present Stock Value = $2 / 0.10 = $20 per share.",

Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee (the “MP&D Committee”) of CVS Health’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).

As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 17 million shares of CVS Health common stock available for future grants under the ICP.",
