Using the formula <Annualized Volatility = Standard Deviation of Annual Returns * sqrt(Number of Years)>, we can determine the annualized volatility. However, additional data (the standard deviation of annual returns) is needed to calculate the answer."

The report provides some information on debt (mortgages, securities), but we would need further information on the company's total debt and total equity to answer this question.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Return on Equity (ROE) for 2012?\nAnswer 2: The formula for ROE is <Return on Equity = Net Income / Shareholder's Equity>. We would need the Net Income and Shareholder's Equity for the year 2012 to calculate this.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for 2012?\nAnswer 3: To calculate EPS, we would need to use the formula <Earnings Per Share = Net Income / Outstanding Shares>. The report does not provide information on the company's net income or the number of outstanding shares, so we would need this information to calculate the EPS.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the current ratio for 2012?\nAnswer 4: The formula for the current ratio is <Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities>. The report does not provide information on the company's current assets or current liabilities, so we would need this information to calculate the current ratio.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) for 2012?\nAnswer 5: The formula for DSCR is <Debt Service Coverage Ratio = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service>. The report does not provide information on the company's net operating income or total debt service, so we would need this information to calculate the DSCR.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What is the Loss Given Default (LGD) for the residential mortgages at fair value in 2012?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <LGD = (Unpaid Balance - Recovery) / Unpaid Balance>, we would need to know the Recovery amount to solve for LGD.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) for the commercial mortgages at fair value in 2012?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <DSCR = Net Operating Income / Total Debt Service>, we would need to know the Net Operating Income and Total Debt Service to solve for DSCR.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Weighted Average Life (WAL) of the total commercial mortgages in 2012?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <WAL = ∑(Time Period x Cash Flow) / ∑ Cash Flow>, we would need to know the time period and cash flow of each commercial mortgage to solve for WAL.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the Loan to Value Ratio (LTV) for the residential mortgages at lower of cost or market in 2012?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <LTV = Loan Amount / Appraised Value>, we would need to know the Appraised Value to solve for LTV.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the Yield to Maturity (YTM) for the asset-backed securities in 2012?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula for YTM which is a bit complex and involves solving for 'r' in the equation <P = C(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r + FV(1 + r)^-n>, where P is the price of the bond, C is the annual coupon payment, FV is the face value of the bond, r is the yield to maturity (rate of return), and n is the number of years to maturity.

This information is not provided in the report.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the ratio of owned to leased facilities in the United States?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Owned to Leased Ratio = Total Owned Facilities / Total Leased Facilities>, we know that in the United States, the total owned facilities are 30.7 million square feet and the total leased facilities are 2.1 million square feet. So the answer is 30.7/2.1.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the percentage of total facilities located in other countries?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Percentage of Total Facilities in Other Countries = (Total Facilities in Other Countries / Total Facilities) * 100>, we know that the total facilities in other countries are 23.2 million square feet and the total facilities are 56.0 million square feet. So the answer is (23.2/56.0) * 100."

As indicated in our 2017 resolution plan, the parent company has amended and restated its support agreement with its material entities, as defined in our 2017 resolution plan. ",
            "Under the secured amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the parent company would be obligated to contribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its contributable material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material entities. The obligations of the parent company under the secured amended and restated support agreement are in most cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the parent company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company). As a result, claims of our material entities against the assets of the parent company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the parent company) are effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the parent company.

So if the price of crude oil decreases by ￥2.00 per barrel, the impact on the annual net margin would be 2 * 1.0 million."

facility matures August 28, 2020, with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall it extend beyond August 28, 2022.\nThis facility replaces the prior ¥1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on November 1, 2011, which would have matured November 1, 2017.\nAs of and for the periods ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility.\nWe currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.\nIf our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase.\nConversely, if our long-term debt rating were to improve, the facility fee and interest rate would decrease.\nChanges in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility.\nUnder this committed revolving credit facility, we have agreed to various covenants.\nThese covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets, the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur, as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth.\nIn the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant, and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.\nLiquidity is also provided by our ¥2 billion commercial paper program, which increased ¥1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016.\nDuring the year ended May 31, 2016, we did not issue commercial paper, and as of May 31, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings under this program.\nAny future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs.\nWe currently have short-term debt ratings of A1+ and P1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively.\nAs of May 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling ¥5.5 billion, of which ¥4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries.\nIncluded in cash and equivalents as of May 31, 2016 was ¥105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity.\nCash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate notes, U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities.\nOur fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk.\nAll of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk.\nWhile individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2016, the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days.\nTo date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs.\nFuture volatility in the capital markets, however, may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.\nWe believe that existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed.\nWe routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which U.S. taxes have previously been provided.\nWe also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings.\nShould we require additional capital in the United States, we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the United States through debt.\nIf we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds, we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes less applicable foreign tax credits.\nIf we elect to raise capital in the United States through debt, we would incur additional interest expense.\nIn connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor.\nCurrently, we have several such agreements in place.\nHowever, based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations.\nOur significant long-term contractual obligations as of May 31, 2016 and significant endorsement contracts, including related marketing commitments, entered into through the date of this report are as follows:.\n\ndescription of commitment ( in millions ) | description of commitment 2017 | description of commitment 2018 | description of commitment 2019 |

            "Question 1: What is the Operating Profit Margin in 2014?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Operating Profit Margin = Operating Income / Total Sales>, we know that the Operating Income in 2014 is ¥88.2 million and Total Sales is ¥450.4 million. So the answer is 88.2 / 450.4 = 0.196 or 19.6%.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Year Over Year (YoY) growth rate in sales from 2012 to 2013?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <YoY Growth Rate = (Current Year Value - Previous Year Value) / Previous Year Value>, we know that the sales in 2013 is ¥451.1 million and in 2012 is ¥420.1 million. So the answer is (451.1 - 420.1) / 420.1 = 0.0738 or 7.38%.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in operating income from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value) ^ (1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we know that the operating income in 2012 is ¥44.6 million and in 2014 is ¥88.2 million. So the answer is (88.2 / 44.6) ^ (1 / 2) - 1 = 0.3915 or 39.15%.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the Return on Sales (ROS) for the year 2013?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <ROS = Operating Income / Sales>, we know that the Operating Income in 2013 is ¥65.5 million and Sales is ¥451.1 million. So the answer is 65.5 / 451.1 = 0.145 or 14.5%.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the Sales Growth Rate from 2013 to 2014?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Sales Growth Rate = (Sales in Current Year - Sales in Previous Year) / Sales in Previous Year>, we know that the sales in 2014 is ¥450.4 million and in 2013 is ¥451.1 million.

            "Notes to consolidated financial statements J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Conduits.",
            "Commercial paper issued by conduits for which the firm acts as administrator aggregated ¥11.7 billion at December 31, 2003, and ¥17.5 billion at December 31, 2002.",
            "The commercial paper issued is backed by sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and commitments to provide liquidity to support receiving at least an A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, an F1 rating.",
            "The firm had commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to ¥18.0 billion at December 31, 2003, and ¥23.5 billion at December 31, 2002.",
            "Third-party banks had commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles in an amount up to ¥700 million at December 31, 2003, and up to ¥900 million at December 31, 2002.",
            "Asset-specific liquidity is the primary source of liquidity support for the conduits.",
            "In addition, program-wide liquidity is provided by JPMorgan Chase to these vehicles in the event of short-term disruptions in the commercial paper market; these commitments totaled ¥2.6 billion and ¥2.7 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.",
            "For certain multi-seller conduits, JPMorgan Chase also provides limited credit enhancement, primarily through the issuance of letters of credit.",
            "Commitments under these letters of credit totaled ¥1.9 billion and ¥3.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.",
            "JPMorgan Chase applies the same underwriting standards in making liquidity commitments to conduits as the firm would with other extensions of credit.",
            "If JPMorgan Chase were downgraded below A-1, P-1 and, in certain cases, F1, the firm could also be required to provide funding under these liquidity commitments, since commercial paper rated below A-1, P-1 or F1 would generally not be issuable by the vehicle.",
            "Under these circumstances, the firm could either replace itself as liquidity provider or facilitate the sale or refinancing of the assets held in the vie in other markets.",
            "JPMorgan Chase's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles at December 31, 2003, is ¥18.7 billion, as the firm cannot be obligated to fund the entire notional amounts of asset-specific liquidity, program-wide liquidity and credit enhancement facilities at the same time.",
            "However, the firm views its credit exposure to multi-seller conduit transactions as limited.",
            "This is because, for the most part, the firm is not required to fund under the liquidity facilities if the assets in the vie are in default.",
            "Additionally, the firm's obligations under the letters of credit are secondary to the risk of first loss provided by the client or other third parties – for example, by the overcollateralization of the vie with the assets sold to it.",
            "JPMorgan Chase consolidated these asset-backed commercial paper conduits at July 1, 2003, in accordance with FIN 46 and recorded the assets and liabilities of the conduits on its consolidated balance sheet.",
            "In December 2003, one of the multi-seller conduits was restructured with the issuance of preferred securities acquired by an independent third-party investor, who will absorb the majority of the expected losses of the conduit.",
            "In determining the primary beneficiary of the conduit, the firm leveraged an existing rating agency model that is an independent market standard to size the expected losses and considered the relative rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders.",
            "As a result of the restructuring, JPMorgan Chase deconsolidated approximately ¥5.4 billion of the vehicle's assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2003.",
            "The remaining conduits continue to be consolidated on the firm's balance sheet at December 31, 2003: ¥4.8 billion of assets recorded in loans, and ¥1.5 billion of assets recorded in available-for-sale securities.",
            "Client intermediation as a financial intermediary, the firm is involved in structuring vie transactions to meet investor and client needs.",
            "The firm intermediates various types of risks (including, for example, fixed income, equity and credit), typically using derivative instruments.",
            "In certain circumstances, the firm also provides liquidity and other support to the vies to facilitate the transaction.",
            "The firm's current exposure to nonconsolidated vies is reflected in its consolidated balance sheet or in the notes to consolidated financial statements.",
            "The risks inherent in derivative instruments or liquidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit, market and liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed.",
            "Assets held by certain client intermediation-related vies at December 31, 2003 and 2002, were as follows:.",

            "The firm retains a second-risk-of-loss position for these vehicles and does not absorb a majority of the expected losses of the vehicles.",
            "Documentation includes provisions intended, subject to certain conditions, to enable JPMorgan Chase to terminate the transactions related to a particular loan vehicle if the value of the relevant portfolio declines below a specified level.",

            "JPMorgan Chase was committed to provide liquidity to these vehicles of up to ¥8.0 billion at December 31, 2003, and ¥12.0 billion at December 31, 2002.",
            "The firm's maximum exposure to loss to these vehicles at December 31, 2003, was ¥5.5 billion, which reflects the netting of collateral and other program limits."

            "Question 1: What was the change in the amount of commercial paper issued by conduits between 2002 and 2003?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Change in amount = Current year amount - Previous year amount>, we know the commercial paper issued by conduits was ¥11.7 billion in 2003 and ¥17.5 billion in 2002, so the answer is 11.7 - 17.5 = -5.8 billion yen.\n\nQuestion 2: What was the percentage change in the amount of commercial paper issued by conduits between 2002 and 2003?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Percentage Change = [(Current Year Amount - Previous Year Amount) / Previous Year Amount] * 100>, we know the commercial paper issued by conduits was ¥11.7 billion in 2003 and ¥17.5 billion in 2002, so the answer is [(11.7 - 17.5) / 17.5] * 100 = -33.14%.\n\nQuestion 3: What was the percentage change in the firm's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles between 2002 and 2003?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Percentage Change = [(Current Year Amount - Previous Year Amount) / Previous Year Amount] * 100>, we know the firm's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles was ¥18.7 billion in 2003 and the information for 2002 is not provided, so we cannot answer this question without the 2002 data. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the proportion of the firm's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles compared to the total amount of commercial paper issued by conduits in 2003?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Proportion = (Part / Whole) * 100>, we know the firm's maximum credit exposure to these vehicles was ¥18.7 billion and the total amount of commercial paper issued by conduits was ¥11.7 billion in 2003, so the answer is (18.7 / 11.7) * 100 = 159.83%.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the ratio of the firm's commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles to the total amount of commercial paper issued by conduits in 2003?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Ratio = (Part 1 / Part 2)>, we know the firm's commitments to provide liquidity on an asset-specific basis to these vehicles was ¥18.0 billion and the total amount of commercial paper issued by conduits was ¥11.7 billion in 2003, so the answer is 18.0 / 11.7 = 1.54.\n\n\nQuestion 1: What is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as of December 31, 2003?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Liquidity Coverage Ratio = High Quality Liquid Assets / (Total Net Cash Outflows over 30 days) * 100%>, we need more information to answer this question.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Net Stable Funding Ratio for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as of December 31, 2003?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Net Stable Funding Ratio = (Available amount of Stable Funding / Required amount of Stable Funding) * 100%>, we need more information to answer this question.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Credit Utilization Rate for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as of December 31, 2003?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Credit Utilization Rate = (Total Credit Used / Total Credit Available) * 100%>, we need more information to answer this question.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the Debt to Equity Ratio for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. as of December 31, 2003?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Shareholders' Equity>, we need more information to answer this question.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the Return on Assets (ROA) for J.P.

            "Upon separation, terminated employees will receive lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service. During 2013, we paid approximately ¥15 million in severance payments associated with these actions, with the remainder expected to be paid through the middle of 2015. ",
            "In addition to the severance charges described above, we expect to incur accelerated and incremental costs (e.g., accelerated depreciation expense related to long-lived assets at the sites to be closed, relocation of equipment and other employee related costs) of approximately ¥15 million, ¥50 million, and ¥135 million at our IS&GS, MST, and Space Systems business segments related to the facility closures and consolidations. ",
            "The accelerated and incremental costs will be expensed as incurred in the respective business segment's results of operations through their completion in 2015.

            "Question 1: What is the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for 2013?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <EPS = (Net Earnings - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares>, we know the Net Earnings is reduced by ¥130 million due to restructuring charges and the Average Outstanding Shares for basic computations is 320.9 million. We can assume that Dividends on Preferred Stock do not exist. Therefore, the answer can be calculated as (Net Earnings - 0) / 320.9.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Diluted Earnings Per Share (DEPS) for 2013?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <DEPS = (Net Earnings - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / (Common Shares + Convertible Securities)>, we know the Net Earnings is reduced by ¥130 million due to restructuring charges and the Average Outstanding Shares for diluted computations is 326.5 million. We can assume that Dividends on Preferred Stock do not exist. Therefore, the answer can be calculated as (Net Earnings - 0) / 326.5.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the total restructuring cost for 2013 across all business segments?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <Total Restructuring Cost = Sum of Restructuring Charges + Sum of Accelerated and Incremental Costs>, we know the restructuring charges total to ¥201 million and the accelerated and incremental costs total to ¥200 million (¥15 million + ¥50 million + ¥135 million). Therefore, the total restructuring cost for 2013 across all business segments is ¥201 million + ¥200 million = ¥401 million.\n\nQuestion 4: What is the average cost per employee for the severance payments in 2013?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Average Severance Cost per Employee = Total Severance Payments / Number of Employees>, we know the total severance payments in 2013 is ¥15 million and the total workforce reduced by approximately 4000 positions. Therefore, the answer can be calculated as ¥15 million / 4000."

            "Question 1: What is the average estimated amortization expense over the five succeeding fiscal years starting from 2016?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Average = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)>, the answer can be obtained by adding all the estimated amortization expenses for the five years and then dividing by 5.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the depreciation rate for the estimated amortization expense from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Depreciation Rate = (Initial Value - Salvage Value) / Useful Life>, we can consider the initial value as the amortization expense of fiscal 2016 and the salvage value as the amortization expense of fiscal 2020. The useful life is the period from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020 which is 5 years.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the estimated amortization expense from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we can consider the beginning value as the estimated amortization expense of fiscal 2016 and the ending value as the estimated amortization expense of fiscal 2020. The number of years is the period from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020 which is 5 years. \n\nQuestion 4: If an impairment charge was required, how would the new carrying value of goodwill be calculated after the impairment charge?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <New Carrying Value of Goodwill = Old Carrying Value of Goodwill - Impairment Charge>, the new carrying value can be calculated by subtracting the impairment charge from the old carrying value of goodwill.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the estimated goodwill at the end of fiscal 2016, assuming a depreciation rate of 5% per year?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Depreciated Value = Initial Value * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years>, we can consider the initial value as the goodwill aggregating 2.81 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, the depreciation rate as 5% per year, and the number of years as 1."

However, the duration and the exact relationship between the changes in interest rates and earnings are not provided in the report. \n\nQuestion 2: What is the Value at Risk (VaR) for the firm?\nAnswer 2: To calculate VaR, we need to know the expected loss level, the time period, and the confidence level. None of these values are provided in the financial report.\n\nQuestion 3: If the firm's exposure to rising and falling interest rates is due to corresponding increases and decreases in short-term funding costs, what would be the potential impact on the firm's earnings if the short-term funding costs were to increase by 2%?\nAnswer 3: The exact impact cannot be calculated without knowing the relationship between the firm's earnings and short-term funding costs. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the firm's sensitivity to market volatility?\nAnswer 4: The report does not provide information on the firm's beta, which measures the firm's sensitivity to market volatility. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the firm's exposure to non-statistical risks?\nAnswer 5: The report does not provide sufficient information to calculate the firm's exposure to non-statistical risks."

Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to the company's reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events (e.g., fraud, legal and compliance risks or damage to physical assets). The company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). Legal, regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under \"Legal, regulatory and compliance risk.\" The company has established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the company. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the company and respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. The company has implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, business environment and internal control factors and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment internal control factors and metrics are indirect inputs to the model."

The company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue-generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and control groups (e.g., information technology and trade processing). Legal, regulatory and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under \"Legal, regulatory and compliance risk.\" The company has established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control risk across the company. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in the company and respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. The company has implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, business environment and internal control factors and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements.

Under the Plan, participants may elect to defer base salary and cash incentive compensation in excess of 401(k) plan limitations. Participants under the Plan may choose to invest their deferred amounts in the same investment alternatives available under the company's 401(k) plan. The Plan also allows for company matching contributions for the following: (i) the first 4% (4%) of compensation deferred under the Plan, subject to a maximum of ￥50,000 for board officers, (ii) lost matching amounts that would have been made under the 401(k) plan if participants had not participated in the Plan, and (iii) discretionary amounts as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Committee of the Board of Directors.",
            "Defined contribution plan: The company and certain subsidiaries have various defined contribution plans, in which all eligible employees may participate. In the U.S., the 401(k) plan is a contributory plan. Matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees' contributions. The company's expenses for material defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were ￥31 million, ￥32 million and ￥30 million, respectively.

Each option granted and stock appreciation right has an exercise price of no less than 100% (100%) of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The awards have a contractual life of five to fifteen years and vest over two to four years. Stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed or replaced with comparable stock options or stock appreciation rights in conjunction with a change in control of the company only become exercisable if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or quits for good reason within 24 months of a change in control. The employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to purchase shares of the company's common stock through payroll deductions of up to 20% (20%) of eligible compensation on an after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than ￥25,000 of stock in any calendar year. The price an employee pays per share is 85% (85%) of the lower of the fair market value of the company's stock on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the purchase period.

Wholesale distributors of life-science products account for a substantial portion of our trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. We seek to mitigate the risk associated with this concentration through our ongoing credit-review procedures and insurance. A large portion of our cash is held by a few major financial institutions. We monitor our exposures with these institutions and do not expect any of these institutions to fail to meet their obligations. Major financial institutions represent the largest component of our investments in corporate debt securities. In accordance with documented corporate risk-management policies, we monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporate issuer. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to risk-management instruments but do not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their high credit ratings.

Any change in recorded value is recorded in other-net, (income) expense. ",
            "2022 our public equity investments are measured and carried at fair value. Any change in fair value is recognized in other-net, (income) expense. We review equity investments other than public equity investments for indications of impairment on a regular basis. ",
            "Our derivative activities are initiated within the guidelines of documented corporate risk-management policies and are intended to offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged.

impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.\nEvents that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, including a decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, business climate, operational performance of the business or key personnel, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\nIn performing the impairment test, the company utilizes the two-step approach prescribed under ASC 350.\nThe first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value.\nTo estimate the fair value of its reporting units for step 1, the company primarily utilizes the income approach.\nThe income approach is based on a DCF analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate.\nAssumptions used in the DCF require significant judgment, including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values, growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows.\nThe forecasted cash flows are based on the company's most recent budget and strategic plan and for years beyond this period, the company's estimates are based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date.\nThe company believes its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses.\nThe discount rates used are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital (201cwacc 201d) of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit.\nThe market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (201cebitda 201d) and is primarily used as a corroborative analysis to the results of the DCF analysis.\nThe company believes its assumptions used to determine the fair value of its reporting units are reasonable.\nIf different assumptions were used, particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows, terminal values, WACCs, or market multiples, different estimates of fair value may result and there could be the potential that an impairment charge could result.\nActual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows.\nIf the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any.\nThe second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying value.\nThe implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each reporting unit as of the measurement date and allocating the reporting unit's estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities.\nThe residual amount from performing this allocation represents the implied fair value of goodwill.\nTo the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded.\nThe company

The useful life is the period from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020 which is 5 years.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the estimated amortization expense from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we can consider the beginning value as the estimated amortization expense of fiscal 2016 and the ending value as the estimated amortization expense of fiscal 2020. The number of years is the period from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2020 which is 5 years. \n\nQuestion 4: If an impairment charge was required, how would the new carrying value of goodwill be calculated after the impairment charge?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <New Carrying Value of Goodwill = Old Carrying Value of Goodwill - Impairment Charge>, the new carrying value can be calculated by subtracting the impairment charge from the old carrying value of goodwill.\n\nQuestion 5: What is the estimated goodwill at the end of fiscal 2016, assuming a depreciation rate of 5% per year?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Depreciated Value = Initial Value * (1 - Depreciation Rate)^Number of Years>, we can consider the initial value as the goodwill aggregating 2.81 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, the depreciation rate as 5% per year, and the number of years as 1."

            "Question 1: What is the Earnings per Share (EPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <EPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), and Average Outstanding Shares is 201206. So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / 201206.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Diluted Earnings per Share (DEPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <DEPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / (Common Shares Outstanding + Dilutive Securities)>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), Common Shares Outstanding is 201206, and Dilutive Securities is 0 (as there are no dilutive securities in 2009). So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / (201206 + 0).\n\nQuestion 3: What is the tax shield for the dividends paid to shareholders in 2009?\nAnswer 3: As the company is a REIT, it gets a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. The tax shield can be calculated using the formula <Tax Shield = Tax Rate * Debt>. In this case, we don't have the specific numbers for Tax Rate and Debt. However, the concept of a tax shield would apply. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the dividend payout ratio in 2007?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends / Net Income>, we know that Dividends is -1149 (assuming negative dividends means they were not paid), and Net Income is 210793. So the answer is -1149 / 210793."

            "Question 1: What would be the Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) sensitivity if the Jpmorgan Chase's credit spread increased by 2 basis points on December 31, 2008?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <DVA Sensitivity = Sensitivity for 1 basis point * Increase in Basis Points>, we know the sensitivity for 1 basis point on December 31, 2008 is ￥32 and the increase in basis points is 2, so the answer is 32*2=￥64 million.\n\nQuestion 2: If the firm wants to maintain the Value at Risk (VaR) at the level of ¥85 million under a 95% confidence interval, how many times a year can the firm expect to incur daily losses greater than those predicted by VaR estimates?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <Expected Exceedance = Number of Trading Days * (1- Confidence Level)>, we assume there are 252 trading days in a year and the confidence level is 95%, so the answer is 252*(1-0.95)= approximately 13 times a year.\n\nQuestion 3: If the firm expects an increase in interest rates, how would this impact the firm's net interest income and pre-tax earnings?\nAnswer 3: This requires the use of the formula <Net Interest Income = Interest Income - Interest Expense> and the formula <Pre-tax Earnings = Gross Income - Operating Expenses>. The exact impact would depend on the specifics of the interest rate increase and the firm's interest income and expense. However, generally, an increase in interest rates would increase both the firm's interest income and expense, and thus could impact the net interest income and pre-tax earnings."

            "10. Employee benefit plans Sysco has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans for its employees. Also, the company contributes to various multi-employer plans under collective bargaining agreements and provides certain health care benefits to eligible retirees and their dependents. Sysco maintains a qualified retirement plan (Retirement Plan) that pays benefits to employees at retirement, using formulas based on a participant's years of service and compensation. The defined contribution 401(k) plan provides that under certain circumstances the company may make matching contributions of up to 50% (50%) of the first 6% (6%) of a participant's compensation. Sysco's contributions to this plan were ￥21898000 in 2006, ￥28109000 in 2005, and ￥27390000 in 2004. In addition to receiving benefits upon retirement under the company's defined benefit plan, participants in the management incentive plan (see \"Management Incentive Compensation\" under \"Stock-Based Compensation Plans\") will receive benefits under a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP). This plan is a nonqualified, unfunded supplementary retirement plan. In order to meet its obligations under the SERP, Sysco maintains life insurance policies on the lives of the participants with carrying values of ￥153659000 at July 1, 2006, and ￥138931000 at July 2, 2005. These policies are not included as plan assets or in the funded status amounts in the table below. Sysco is the sole owner and beneficiary of such policies. Projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for the SERP were ￥327450000 and ￥238599000, respectively, as of July 1, 2006, and ￥375491000 and ￥264010000, respectively, as of July 2, 2005. The company made cash contributions to its pension plans of ￥73764000 and ￥220361000 in fiscal years 2006 and 2005, respectively, including ￥66000000 and ￥214000000 in voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2006, the company's voluntary contribution to the Retirement Plan represented the maximum tax-deductible amount. In fiscal 2005, the company made a voluntary contribution of ￥134000000 in the fourth quarter in addition to the ￥80000000."

The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, \"Leases\", as the non-cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% (75%) of the equipment's estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% (90%) of the equipment's fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term.

            "Question 1: What is the average annual increase in rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Average Annual Increase = [(End Value/Start Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1]>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the present value of future lease obligations discounted at an annual interest rate of 5%?\nAnswer 2: We can use the formula for present value of an annuity: <Present Value = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r]>, where C is the annual cash flow (lease payment), r is the interest rate (5% or 0.05), and n is the number of years. As the lease payments vary by year, we need to calculate the present value of each year's lease payment separately and then sum them up.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (End Value / Start Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the ratio of the total future minimum rental payments to the aggregate rent expense in 2014?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Ratio = Total Future Minimum Rental Payments / Aggregate Rent Expense>, we know the Total Future Minimum Rental Payments is ¥6903188 thousand and the Aggregate Rent Expense is ¥655.0 million. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the annual depreciation expense if the total lease obligations are depreciated straight-line over 10 years?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Annual Depreciation Expense = (Total Lease Obligations / Useful Life)>, we know the Total Lease Obligations is ¥6903188 thousand and the Useful Life is 10 years. So the answer can be calculated with this formula."

            "Question 1: What is the Earnings per Share (EPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <EPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / Average Outstanding Shares>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), and Average Outstanding Shares is 201206. So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / 201206.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the Diluted Earnings per Share (DEPS) in 2009?\nAnswer 2: Using the formula <DEPS = (Net Income - Dividends on Preferred Stock) / (Common Shares Outstanding + Dilutive Securities)>, we know that Net Income is -335360, Dividends on Preferred Stock is 0 (assuming there is no preferred stock), Common Shares Outstanding is 201206, and Dilutive Securities is 0 (as there are no dilutive securities in 2009). So the answer is (-335360 - 0) / (201206 + 0).\n\nQuestion 3: What is the tax shield for the dividends paid to shareholders in 2009?\nAnswer 3: As the company is a REIT, it gets a tax deduction for the dividends it pays to shareholders. The tax shield can be calculated using the formula <Tax Shield = Tax Rate * Debt>. In this case, we don't have the specific numbers for Tax Rate and Debt. However, the concept of a tax shield would apply. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the dividend payout ratio in 2007?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Dividend Payout Ratio = Dividends / Net Income>, we know that Dividends is -1149 (assuming negative dividends means they were not paid), and Net Income is 210793. So the answer is -1149 / 210793."

The exact impact would depend on the specifics of the interest rate increase and the firm's interest income and expense.

            "Question 1: What is the Effective Interest Rate on the 2019 notes?\nAnswer 1: The Effective Interest Rate can be calculated using the formula <Effective Interest Rate = [1 + (Nominal Rate / Number of Compounding periods)] ^ (Number of Compounding periods) - 1>. Here, we know the Nominal Rate is 5.00% for the 2019 notes, but we don't have information on the number of compounding periods. \n\nQuestion 2: What is the Debt to Equity ratio for the year 2013?\nAnswer 2: The Debt to Equity ratio can be calculated using the formula <Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity>. However, we do not have the total equity value for the year 2013 in the report.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the total cost of all the notes issued in 2013 including the amortized discount and debt issuance costs?\nAnswer 3: The total cost can be calculated using the formula <Total Cost = Carrying Value + Unamortized Discount + Debt Issuance Costs>. We have the carrying value and unamortized discount for the notes issued in 2013, but we don't have the exact debt issuance costs for these notes. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the company in 2013?\nAnswer 4: WACC can be calculated using the formula <WACC = [(Cost of Equity * Percentage of Equity) + (Cost of Debt * Percentage of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate))]. In the report, we don't have the cost of equity, percentage of equity, percentage of debt, or the tax rate for the company in 2013. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the current ratio for the company in 2013?\nAnswer 5: The Current Ratio can be calculated using the formula <Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities>. However, we do not have the values for current assets or current liabilities for the year 2013 in the report."

            "Note 17 2014 Sales-type leases and financing receivables: In April 2017, in conjunction with the implementation of a new \"go-to-market\" business model for the company's U.S. dispensing business within the Medication Management Solutions (MMS) unit of the Medical segment, the company amended the terms of certain customer leases for dispensing equipment within the MMS unit. The modification provided customers the ability to reduce its dispensing asset base via a return provision, resulting in a more flexible lease term. Prior to the modification, these leases were accounted for as sales-type leases in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, \"Leases\", as the non-cancellable lease term of 5 years exceeded 75% (75%) of the equipment's estimated useful life and the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 90% (90%) of the equipment's fair value. As a result of the lease modification, the company was required to reassess the classification of the leases due to the amended lease term. Accordingly, most amended lease contracts were classified as operating leases beginning in April 2017. The change in lease classification resulted in a pre-tax charge to earnings in fiscal year 2017 of ¥748 million, which was recorded in other operating expense, net. Beginning April 1, 2017, revenue associated with these modified contracts has been recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term, along with depreciation on the reinstated leased assets.

Stock options granted after February 8, 2012 were converted into stock options to acquire shares of Hologic common stock determined by a conversion formula defined in the merger agreement. The company paid the Gen-Probe shareholders ￥3.8 billion and ￥169.0 million to equity award holders. The company funded the acquisition using available cash and financing consisting of senior secured credit facilities and senior notes (see note 5 for further discussion) resulting in aggregate proceeds of ￥3.48 billion, excluding financing fees to the underwriters.

            "Question 1: What is the average annual increase in rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 1: Using the formula <Average Annual Increase = [(End Value/Start Value)^(1/Number of Years) - 1]>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula.\n\nQuestion 2: What is the present value of future lease obligations discounted at an annual interest rate of 5%?\nAnswer 2: We can use the formula for present value of an annuity: <Present Value = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r]>, where C is the annual cash flow (lease payment), r is the interest rate (5% or 0.05), and n is the number of years. As the lease payments vary by year, we need to calculate the present value of each year's lease payment separately and then sum them up.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of the rent expense from 2012 to 2014?\nAnswer 3: Using the formula <CAGR = (End Value / Start Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1>, we know the Start Value is ¥419.0 million in 2012, the End Value is ¥655.0 million in 2014, and the Number of Years is 3. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 4: What is the ratio of the total future minimum rental payments to the aggregate rent expense in 2014?\nAnswer 4: Using the formula <Ratio = Total Future Minimum Rental Payments / Aggregate Rent Expense>, we know the Total Future Minimum Rental Payments is ¥6903188 thousand and the Aggregate Rent Expense is ¥655.0 million. So the answer can be calculated with this formula. \n\nQuestion 5: What is the annual depreciation expense if the total lease obligations are depreciated straight-line over 10 years?\nAnswer 5: Using the formula <Annual Depreciation Expense = (Total Lease Obligations / Useful Life)>, we know the Total Lease Obligations is ¥6903188 thousand and the Useful Life is 10 years.
